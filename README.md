# US-Tree-Analysis

Analyzed the tree species across the United States for our customer who is going to be moving out of NYC soon and wants to avoid states or cities that may affect his allergies. Our client also wants to experience the seasonal fall foliage and loves to be out in nature. We cleaned and prepared the data using Python and visualized our results and recommendation on Tableau: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/matthew.luong/viz/USTreeAnalysis-EnvironmentalInfluenceforMoving/USTreeAnalysis#1
